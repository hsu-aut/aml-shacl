# Validation of Textual Constraints Against AML Models

## Motivation
We previously developed [AML2OWL](https://github.com/hsu-aut/aml2owl), a tool to convert AutomationML models into ontologies and check these ontologies against SHACL shapes. But who is going to create these SHACL constraints? This is exactly where this tool comes into play. 
It generates SHACL shapes for textual constraints and validates these shapes against the AML models. And if there are any validation errors, it gives easy-to-understand explanations as well.
